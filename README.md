<!-- UPDATE: describe what this repository contains -->

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this
repository contains an example assignment for use with GatorGrader and
GatorGradle. Since the Travis builds for this repository will initially fail
(as evidenced by a red &#x2717; appearing in the commit logs instead of a green
&#x2714;), the programmer is responsible for completing all of the steps needed
to satisfy the requirements for the assignment, thus causing a &#x2714; to
instead appear in the commit logs.

## Introduction

<!-- UPDATE: introduce and describe the assignment here -->

Introduce the assignment here. As verified by
[Checkstyle](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle), the source code for all
of the Java source code files must adhere to all of the requirements in the
[Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

The programmer is also responsible for writing a reflection, stored in the file
`writing/reflection.md`, that responds to the questions in the assignment sheet
and explains the challenges that you faced and the solutions you developed.
Please note that this is a Markdown file that must adhere to the standards
described in the [Markdown Syntax
Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Remember, you
can preview the contents of a committed Markdown file by clicking on the name of
the file in your GitHub repository. Finally, don't forget that your
`writing/reflection.md` file should adhere to the Markdown standards established
by the [Markdown linting tool](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint) and
the writing standards set by the [Proselint tool](http://proselint.com/).

The source code in the submitted Java source code files must also pass
additional tests set by the [GatorGrader
tool](https://github.com/gatored/gatorgrader).

When you use the `git commit` command to transfer your source code to your
GitHub repository, [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) will initialize a build
of your assignment, checking to see if it meets all of the requirements. If both
your source code and writing meet all of the established requirements, then you
will see a green &#x2714; in the listing of commits in GitHub. If your
submission does not meet the requirements, a red &#x2717; will appear instead.
The instructor will reduce a programmer's grade for this assignment if the red
&#x2717; appears on the last commit in GitHub immediately before the
assignment's due date.

A carefully formatted assignment sheet for this project provides more details
about the steps that a computer scientist should take to complete this
assignment. You can view this assignment sheet by visiting the listing of
laboratories on the course web site.

## Learning

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub
Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features
that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the
following GitHub guides: [Mastering
Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Hello
World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and [Documenting Your
Projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/). Each of these
guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com) and
[GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).

<!-- UPDATE: specify reading assignments -->

To do well on this assignment, you should also review Chapter XX in your course
textbook. Please see the course instructor or one of the teaching assistants or
tutors if you have questions about any of these reading assignments.

## Commands

To get started in using the GatorGrader tool, you must change into the directory
for this assignment. Then, if you want to perform all of the checks that will
automatically evaluate your assignment, you can type the command `gradle grade`.

Running this command will produce a lot of output that you should carefully
inspect. If the last line of the output indicates that GatorGrader judges that
there are no mistakes in the assignment, then this means that your source code
and writing are passing all of the automated checks. However, if the last line
of the output indicates that there are mistakes, then you will need to
understand what they are and then try to fix them.

You can also complete several other important Java programming tasks by using the
`gradle` tool. For instance, you can compile (i.e., create bytecode from the
program's source code if it is a correct program) the program using the command
`gradle build`. There are also additional commands that you can type:

- `gradle clean`: clean the project of all the derived files
- `gradle check`: check the quality of the code using Checkstyle
- `gradle build`: create the bytecode from the Java source code
- `gradle run`: run the Java program in the command-line
- `gradle cleanTest`: clean the JUnit test suite of derived files
- `gradle test`: run the JUnit test suite and produce report
- `gradle tasks`: display details about the Gradle system

To run one of these commands, you must be in the home directory for this
assignment where the `build.gradle` file is located. Then, you can type the
command in the terminal and study the output.

## Output

Typing the command `gradle run` in the terminal window produces the following
output for the instructor's version of `samplelab.SampleLabMain`.

<!-- UPDATE: add sample output -->

Some sample output should be included here.

## Checking

In addition to making the checks that are mentioned in the introduction to this
document, your final submission must meet the following requirements.

<!-- UPDATE: add check details -->

The checks enabled in `config/gatorgrader.yml` should be detailed here.

## Updates

If the course instructor updates the provided material for this assignment and
you would like to receive these updates, then you can type this command in the
main directory for this assignment:

<!-- UPDATE: add starter repository link -->

```
git remote add download <starter repository git uri>
```

You should only need to type this command once; typing the command additional
times may yield an error message but will not negatively influence the state of
your repository. Now, you are ready to download the updates provided by the
course instructor by typing:

```
git pull download master
```

This second command can be run whenever the course instructor needs to provide
you with new source code for this assignment. However, please note that, if you
have edited the files that the course instructor updated, running the previous
command may lead to Git merge conflicts. If this happens, you may need to
manually resolve them with the help of the instructor or a teaching assistant.

## Travis

This assignment uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) to automatically run
the grading checks every time you commit to your GitHub repository. The
checking will start as soon as you have accepted the assignment, thus creating
your own private repository, and the course instructor enables Travis for it. If
you are using Travis for the first time, you will need to authorize Travis CI to
access the private repositories that you created on GitHub.

## Requirements

The GatorGrader and GatorGradle software that supports the checking of this
assignment was developed for the following software and versions:

- Gradle 4.6
- Java 1.8.0
- JUnit 4.9.0
- MDL 0.4.0
- Proselint 0.7.0
- Python 3.5.2

## Problems

<!-- UPDATE: update links to your starter repository and lab sheets repository -->

If you have found a problem with this assignment's provided source code, then
you can go to the [GatorGrader Sample Assignment](https://github.com/gatored/gatorgrader-samplelab)
repository and create an issue by clicking the "Issues" tab and then clicking
the green "New Issue" button. If you have found a problem with the [GatorGrader
tool](https://github.com/gatored/gatorgrader) and the way that it checks your
assignment, then you can follow the aforementioned steps to create an issue in
its repository. To ensure that your issue is properly resolved, please provide
as many details as is possible about the problem that you experienced. If you
discover a problem with the laboratory assignment sheet, then please raise an
issue in the [course-sheets](https://github.com/<yoursheetslink>) repository
and mention this assignment.

Students who find, and use the appropriate GitHub issue tracker to correctly
document, a mistake in any aspect of this laboratory assignment will receive
free laptop stickers and extra credit towards their grade for it.

## Assistance

If you are having trouble completing any part of this project, then please talk
with either the course instructor or a teaching assistant during the laboratory
session. Alternatively, you may ask questions in the Slack team for this
course. Finally, you can schedule a meeting during the course instructor's
